## General FAQs

<details>
<summary><b>What are the recipient types available for digital disbursement payments?</b></summary>

DDP supports 2 recipient types – Consumer and Company.

Consumer is an individual or a person. Company is usually a business or business user.

<details>
<summary><b>What should a customer do if the amount of the payment issued to them is incorrect? </b></summary>

This can be handled in 2 ways:

1) The portal allows the customer to reject a payout due to incorrect amount. Once rejected, the customer can enter the reason for the rejection—i.e. Incorrect amount—and a notification will be sent to the client. The client can issue a new payment for the correct amount.

2) The client can cancel the payment and void it prior to the customer accepting. Once the transaction is canceled, the client can issue a new payment for the correct amount.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How often can I send my customers payments? </b></summary>

There is no limit on how many payments a client can send their customer through this system. The customer, however, may have limits on how much they can accept on their debit card on daily or monthly basis.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I stop a payment once it has been sent to a customer? </b></summary>

If the payment has been sent but not accepted, the client can perform a cancellation through the Digital Payouts platform. If the payment has been accepted by the customer, the client would need to perform a reversal. A reversal can only be completed if the payment was accepted to a bank account via Bank Transfer. A payment accepted to a debit card cannot be reversed.

Number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT). Example : 1654537809
  
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can we send some other number sequence instead of EPOCH in the file name?</b></summary>

No. We mandate epoch & there is a separate field for version. This is standardized across all clients. We do this for few reasons.

- Created Date for all records in a file is same - So it makes sense to put it on file-name - and we need that info.
- EPOCH by itself is a standard. By default, it enforces GMT and Consumes 10 digits.
- Other Date format with seconds precision takes at least 14 digits - without TZ info.
- EPOCH time is available in all programming languages - from java-script and shell script.

This FTP and PGP key information is given by our MFT team once the mailboxes are setup. Prior to this we need a File Gateway Onboarding form completed by the client. If there are any questions or concerns with this process the MFT team should be able to provide assistance or point you in the right direction. Once this is filled out we can submit a ticket to our MFT team to get this setup completed. Once this is completed then they should have the FTP and PGP key information readily available to be shared.
